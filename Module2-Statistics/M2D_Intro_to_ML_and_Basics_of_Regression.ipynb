One way to address this is to use polynomial features.  This is a simple way to add complexity to the model, and can be done by adding higher order terms of the features to the model.  For example, if we have a single feature $x$, we can add a quadratic term $x^2$ to the model, or a cubic term $x^3$, etc.  This can be done for multiple features as well.

We have seen how to fit a linear regression model to data, how to evaluate the model using the R^2 score, and how to account for model bias and overfitting using regularization. We have also seen how to use modern machine learning tools like neural networks, decision trees, random forests, and Bayesian regression to solve regression problems.\n",

        "* **Regression** is a type of machine learning that is used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.\n",
        "* **Linear regression** is a simple regression model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.\n",
        "* **Linear regression with polynomial features** is a way to add complexity to the model by including higher order terms of the features.\n",
        "* **Regularization** is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
        "* **Neural networks** are a type of machine learning model that uses multiple layers of interconnected nodes to learn complex patterns in the data.\n",
        "* **Decision trees** are a type of model that makes decisions based on a series of if-then-else statements.\n",
        "* **Random forests** are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make a final prediction.\n",
